# Food Preference Survey 2019 EDA
The insights and analysis derived from a dataset titled Food Preference Survey 2019 are analysed and visualised. 
 
## Language
 The EDA was done in R.

## Conclusion
The data suggests that certain age, nationalities, and gender groups may have different preferences when it comes to food and beverages. For instance, Indians may prefer traditional cuisine over western cuisine due to a concern for their health. Similar to how children, youth, adults, and seniors all exhibit a greater preference for fresh juice over carbonated drinks. Additionally, in the case of desserts, women may respond neutrally owing to cultural and/or societal expectations, whereas men express a clearer preference for said sweets. The majority of participants preferred the healthier food and beverage options or were influenced by the associated health-related stigma around the choices, as was the case for females and their neutral response for desserts, suggesting that there may be a health consciousness factor at play. Further research would be required to explore this factor and other factors that might influence food and beverage preferences, such as societal roles and taste preferences.
